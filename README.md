# React Hangman

#### Hangman is a word guessing game built with ReactJS. 
Check it out on [Heroku](https://limitless-beyond-28378.herokuapp.com/)

##TODOS:

* Refactor handleGuesses method into multiple, separate methods in Hangman.js 
* Break out New Game - button to separate component
* Split into separate components where possible
* Add hangman illustration for wrong guesses
* Add responsiveness for long words
* Add styling â€“ check fonts, colors...

## Ideas
* Allow user to change background color
* Allow user to choose difficulty level
